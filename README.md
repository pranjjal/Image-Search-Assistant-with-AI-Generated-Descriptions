# Image-Search-Assistant-with-AI-Generated-Descriptions
This project is a web-based tool that allows users to upload images, provide search prompts, and retrieve relevant web search results. By combining image captioning AI models and a web search API, the tool enhances the search process by generating contextual descriptions of images and returning web results based on user-defined prompts.
